## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This is a beginner-friendly *Library Management System* built in *C++* using *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* concepts.  

It allows:
- *Admins* to add, view, and delete books  
- *Users* to search, borrow, and return books  
- Data is managed using *C++ STL containers* (unordered_map, vector, etc.)  

This project is *console-based* and is ideal for learning *C++ OOP + Data Structures*.
